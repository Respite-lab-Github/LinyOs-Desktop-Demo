## Project introduction

'linyOS-Desktop-Demo' is a demonstration project of an HTML-based operating system desktop environment. linyOS is an open source project initiated and maintained by a group of students who are passionate about operating systems and front-end technology. It aims to simulate a lightweight desktop environment through front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, thereby demonstrating the basic functions and interface interactions of the operating system. After this is accomplished, liny OS will officially begin the underlying development as a new cloud operating system similar to chromeOS.

### Project objectives

1. Provide a web-based operating system desktop environment demonstration to facilitate users to understand the basic working principles of the operating system.
2. Improve students' front-end technology level and teamwork ability through practical project practice.
3. As an open source project, attract more developers to participate in and jointly promote the development and improvement of the project.

### Main function

- ** Window management ** : Support multi-window opening, closing, switching and layout adjustment.
- ** ICONS and Taskbars ** : Provides desktop ICONS and taskbars for users to quickly launch applications and view system status.
- ** File Manager ** : emulates the basic operations of the file system, such as file browsing, creating, and deleting.
- ** System Settings ** : Provides basic system Settings options, such as theme change, network Settings, etc.

## Development method

### Technology stack

- **HTML** : Basic structure and content used to build pages.
- **CSS** : Used for style design, including color, layout, animation, etc.
- **JavaScript** : Used to implement interaction logic and business functions.

### Development process

1. ** Requirement analysis ** : Clear project objectives and functional requirements, and formulate development plans.
2. ** Design ** : Design the interface and interaction of the desktop environment, including layout, ICONS, animations, etc.
3. ** Coding ** : Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript for coding.
4. ** Test ** : Test each function to ensure that it meets the requirements.
5. ** Optimization ** : Optimize and adjust according to the test results to improve the user experience.
6. ** Deployment and Release ** : Deploy the project to a Web server for user access and use.

### TODO (to be done)

- Improve project documentation, including development guidelines, API documentation, etc.
- Optimize interface design and interactive experience.
- Add more system features and applications.
- Implement user login and permission management functions.
- Deploy to a Web server to provide online access.
